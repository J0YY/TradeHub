## TradeHub: Together, we're stronger than the market.

**What IS TradeHub?**

TradeHub is the world's first public trading platform. It's a great place for new investors to learn and grow through sharing their investment portfolio with all other traders worldwide, networking with senior investors, learning new trading strategies and valuation tools, and improving through hands-on practice in a no-commission market.

**Key Points**
    -it's public, encourages an open, welcoming environment for investors
    -it's especially suitable for beginners because it provides learning opportunity as well
    -everyone can share strategies, as well as viewing and analyzing each other's profile. This way, everyone can improve!
    -stock prices on our platform are real-time, so everything's super accurate!

## Inspiration

We were inspired by an unfortunate lack of resources to really learn trading in today's society. With 
the increasing number of new traders, especially during the Gamestop series, we thought it would be useful for traders to have a platform specifically dedicates for them to learn from each other.

## How we built it

We used reactjs for the front end and firebase's cloud firestore as a real time database for the back end. We also used figma for design.

## Challenges we ran into

Incredible file system size! Believe it or not, we had nearly 100 files with this project. I wouldn't be surprised if a few hours of our time were actually spent sorting through the numerous folders and trying to update the imports in vsCode as the files grew and grew. 
Other than that, UI proved to be challenging as well as certain issues we had with firebase. It proved to be a tedious and taxing journey to be able to develop this project to where we now are, but we both learned a lot and are proud of how far we have come.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We made a functional trading system where you can buy and sell with real-time prices. We also made a fast, elegant live stock-sharing and blogging system where users can really communicate. Not to mention the overall UI we have is BEAUTIFUL. All of this is no small feat for less than a day of programming!

## What's next for TradeHub

Add actual trading capability, perhaps connect with payment systems so that users can really invest. Ask experienced investors to share their experience on the platform, so that everyone can learn and improve!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
